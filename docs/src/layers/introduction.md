# Introduction

Layers are the key building block of SplitApplyPlots.

Each layer is composed of the following fields.

- [Data](@ref).
- [Mappings](@ref).
- Transformations:
    - [Visual Transformations](@ref),
    - [Data Transformations](@ref).

Layers can be combined with [Algebraic Operations](@ref).

Finally, [Drawing Layers](@ref) is the last step of the pipeline.
